            <p>This is a VR game developed by MTSU's VR club in which I was the lead programmer and co-game designer. It
              was developed within Unity Engine and programed in C# code.</p>

            <p>This is a project I completed with a group of Computer Science students for a team at Vanderbuilt University looking to have an easy to use UI for nurses working with assisted living patients.
              The app's main functionality is building a queue, loading, saving, and running exercises for a patient to perform. It does not do much in it's current state, but in the end, hopefully the app could
               be easily adapted to work alongside a little robot that shows patients a set of exercises they need to perform and can give feedback through a sensor watching the patient. This project was created 
               with Unity and the build for Windows will download once you click the above link.

            <p>This web page includes links to multiple projects I completed in a Web Technologies class. These show off
              my skills in html, css, javascript, and php programming. I also completed two sql projects, but they are not
              included due to needing a database, something replit doesn't offer.</p>
