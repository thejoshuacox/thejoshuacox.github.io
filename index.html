        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Josh Cox, and I'm a computer scientist from Middle Tennessee. I have obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Math and Animation.
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout my academic journey, I have explored various subjects that are integral to modern computing. From foundational concepts such as Compiler Design, Assembly, and Computer Systems to the broader realm of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Web Technologies, I've garnered a robust understanding of the core principles that underpin the digital world. Additionally, my explorations have delved into other domains like Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks, whetting my appetite for cutting-edge technologies and their real-world applications.
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Experienced in languages such as C/C++, C#, Java, Python, and HTML/PHP, along with dabbling in JavaScript, SQL, and Swift, I can tackle diverse projects and challenges. This proficiency has been honed through academic learning and practical hands-on experience, allowing me to transition between different technology stacks seamlessly.
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, my minor in Mathematics has endowed me with a keen analytical mindset, aiding me in deciphering complex problems and crafting elegant solutions. Moreover, my minor in Animation is a testament to my creativity and passion for storytelling through visualsâ€”a trait that I believe adds a unique dimension to my approach as a computer scientist.
