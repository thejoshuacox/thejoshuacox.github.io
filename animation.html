      <h2>Minerva Outpost</h2>
      <p>This was my first animation created entirely within Unreal Engine 5, and also my first animation outside of school! <span class="date">-June 2023</span></p>

        <figcaption>I pieced together this scene for a challenge to myself, as I love Unreal Engine 
            and wanted to get more familiar with it. All of the sci-fi assets where obtained from
            kitbash3D and the envirnment assest from Epic's Valley of the Ancient project.

      <h2>Toy Exhibit</h2>
      <p>Final project for my Texturing, Lighting, and Rendering class. <span class="date">-November 2022</span></p>

        <figcaption>This project was to made to expose us to texturing in Substance Painter. We were to design a "toy" or "gizmo" that appears in a station, performs an action, and then returns back to it's station. My idea involved a big machine made out of those colored building blocks kids use as the main body, then it would recieve a small toy ball, shoot it out, and then move over to retrieve it.
          I hand-animated this in Maya and then transferred it over to Unreal Engine for rendering; there is a glitch where the ball can be seen clipping through the object because the visibility keyframes I set for the ball didn't transfer over to Unreal from Maya.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>This project was to introduce us to texturing in Zbrush, and compositing in After Effects. The goal was to combine multiple animals into one new fantastical creature, and I chose to combine a volture and a crocodile, resulting in this terrifying creature. The model was created in Maya, textured in Zbrush, rendered in Maya, and composited in After Effects.</figcaption>
