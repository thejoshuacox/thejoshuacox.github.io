      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Josh Cox and I'm a computer scientist based in middle Tennessee. I have taken courses
        for
        Discrete Structures, Java, Theory of Programming Languages, Assembly & Computer Organization, Computer Systems,
        Algorithms & Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Software Engineering, Web Technologies,
        and Compiler Design. From these, I have gained experience in C/C++, C#, Java, Python, HTML/PHP, javascript, and
        Swift. <br>I have a passion for making cool or useful things with code and solving problems that I run into
        along the way.

          <p>This is a VR game developed by MTSU's VR club in which I was the lead programmer and co-game designer. It
            was developed within Unity Engine and programed in C# code.</p>

          <p>This web page includes links to multiple projects I completed in a Web Technologies class. These show off
            my skills in html, css, javascript, and php programming. I also completed two sql projects, but they are not
            included due to needing a database, something replit doesn't offer.</p>
